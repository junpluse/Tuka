	/// - Parameters:
	///   - request: A request message to be sent.
	///   - peers: An array of peers that should receive the request.
	/// - Returns: A receipt of the submission.
	/// - Throws: An `Error` if sending the request could not be completed.
	/// - Note: Pass returned receipt to MessageReceiverProtocol.addObserver()
	///         to observe responses of the request.

	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - request: A request message to be sent.
	///   - peers: An array of peers that should receive the request.
	///   - interval: An number of seconds for waiting to complete.
	///   - queue: A dispatch queue which the closure should be added to.
	///   - observer: A closure to be executed when an response event produced by the receiver.
	/// - Returns: A `Disposable` which can be used to stop the invocation of the closure.
	/// - Throws: An `Error` if sending the request could not be completed.
	/// - Note: This method is a combination of MessageSenderProtocol.submit(_:to:) and
	///         MessageReceiverProtocol.addObserver(for:timeoutAfter:on:action:).
